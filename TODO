- Need to write code for when a task is registered after a Queue is already been created. Queues need to get notified that a new task has been registered.
    - In general you should be able to initialize things in any order you want.


- Possibly need better handling for amqp errors.
- Beaver needs flexible retry semantics. Currently there is no automatic retry - once a task fails, it failed.
- Scheduling in the beaver library would ideally write down the last time an execution occurred in a file somewhere, so that it doesn't reschedule immediately on start up every time
- There can be some funky behaviour resulting from DB-scanning if the objects in are being changed
  while the scanning is still occurring. Instead of queueing tasks while cursoring over the database, it might be prudent to instead build up a list of _id's to queue, and then queue all of those objects in one big lump at the end of the scan.
- Unable to store a mongo query inside the parameters for a Task, because Mongo will refuse storing JSON objects that have $'s in the keys.

Documentation to write:
    - Need to create a README example for hooks
    - Need more of a walkthrough style format, rather then relying entirely upon whole examples. The format should hilight relevant sections of the
        example code instead of just copying and pasting in an entire example.
    - More of a description of the Job objects created by the Mongoose plugin.

    - Wish there was a way to get the generated API docs into markdown format.

    - Need to comb over the API docs for missing functions and functions that shouldn't be publicly documented
